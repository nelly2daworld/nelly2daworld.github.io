    <p> As a Howard student for the past few months many individuals asked me about my nationality. It is frustrating to continuously describe where my country is geographically located because many are informed about the Guyana's lcoation on the map. No need to worry anymore because this is one of the reasons I have created this website.  Below you will find a short summary about Guyana's location, the coveted Kaieteur Falls and a few interesting facts about Guyana!  </p>

    <h2> Where is Guyana?</h2>
    <p> Guyana (GUY-ah-nah) not (GHANA) is located at the North-Eastern edge of South America bordered by Venezuala, Brazil and Suriname. Many people ask if English is my second language because I was born in South America; however, Guyana is the only English speaking country and only nation state of the Commonwealth of Nations in South America. Additionally, Guyana is the third-smallest country on the mainland of South America.  </p>

     <h2> Fun Facts about Guyana </h2>
     
    <p> Guyana is a land of six peoples!  Unsurprisingly, our national motto is "One People, One Nation, One Destiny". As can be seen from the image, the flag colors are green, red, yellow, white and black. There are ten administrative regions in Guyana.
